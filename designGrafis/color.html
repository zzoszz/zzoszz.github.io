            There are three primary colors: red, yellow and blue. These represent the building blocks for all the other colors. The secondary colors are obtained by mixing the primqry ones, Red + Yellow = Orange, Red + Blue = Purple, Blue + Yellow = Green. Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing primary and secondary colors. A hue is a dominant family of a given color. Tints, shades and tones are obtained by mixing a color with a white, black and grey respectively. The CMYK color model (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is used for printing. The RGB (Red, Gree, Blue) and HSB (Hue, saturation, brightness) medoles are used in digital media. The hexadecimal or HEX color format is a more friendlier way of representing RGB colors.
