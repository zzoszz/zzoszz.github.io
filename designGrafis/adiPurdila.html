                    <li>A web designer is in charge of designing the front-end of a website or web application</li>
                    <li>A UX designer is in charge of creating the front-end of a website or web app from a user’s
                        perspective. UX (user experience) includes things like information architecture, user
                        psychology,
                        usability testing content strategy, wireframes and interaction design.</li>
                    <li>A UI designer is in charge of the front-end but covers aspects that relate almost exlusively to
                        the
                        visual appearance of the project. UI stands for user interface so it all about things like
                        color,
                        typography, spacing, sizing, shape and so on.
                        Both UX and UI design are 2 separate areas of specialisation within web design. it’s correct to
                        say
                        that you are a UX web designer or UI web designer or both.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Project Brief:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always start a web project with a brief. In the brief be clear about what you’re making and who
                        are you
                        making it for.</li>
                    <li>Be as detailed as possible regarding the final content and include that in the brief.
                        The project brief will serve as a basis for the wireframe.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Wireframes:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A wireframe is a low fidelity version of the final design.</li>
                    <li>A wireframe should display the final content as well as it’s structure.</li>
                    <li>A wireffame should be devoid of any intentional aesthetic decision like color or typography.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Picking the right design tool:</b> For UI design avoid photoshop and illustrator and focus on
                    using a more appropriate app. Sketch, Adobe XD and Figma are great options to consider, each having
                    their pros and cons. My recommendation is Figma because it’s free, cross-platform and works in the
                    browser.</p>

                <p>Color theory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are 3 primary colors: Red, Yellow and Blue. These represent the building blocks for all
                        the other colors.</li>
                    <li>The secondary colors are obtained by mixing the primary ones. Red + Yellow = Orange, Red + Blue
                        = Purple, Blue + Yellow = Green.</li>
                    <li>Tertiary colors are obtained by mixing primary and secondary colors.</li>
                    <li>A hue is the dominant family of a given color.</li>
                    <li>Tints, shades and tones are obtained by mixing a color with white, black and grey respectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>The CMYK color model (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) is used for printing.</li>
                    <li>The RGB (red, green, blue) and HSB (hue, saturation, brightness) models are used in digital
                        media.</li>
                    <li>The HEX (hexadecimal) color format is a more friendlier of representing RGB colors.</li>

                        href="https://fonts.adobe.com/">adobe font</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">google
                        font</a></p>
                <p><b>Understanding the brand and audience</b>, example visit <a
                        href="https://www.swarovski.com/">swarovski</a>, if you need to design for a luxury brand and
                    the feeling you're trying to evoke is that of luxury and sophistication, then you might go for a
                    serif font as the big headliner like swarovski si doing. However, you wouldn't use that serif in a
                    tech website like visit <a href="https://stripe.com/">stripe</a> you would use sans serif to evoke a
                    feeling modern and trust. <b>Readability</b> One very important factor in font choise is readability
                    so after you've chosen a couple of fonts that you think would work well with your project, think
                    about how those fonts would look like in different sizes especially smaller sizes because if you're
                    displaying all this text content of your website on a mobile device and the text is really small and
                    people can't read it, then what do you do. Loading time is something that we often forget about and
                    the thing is The more fonts or font weights we use in our design the slower a loading time of that
                    website is going to be and the bigger the impact on the performance and yes i know that website
                    performance is on the web development side of things so technically not our job but if you're
                    sending a developer a design that requires them to load six or seven different fonts or font weights
                    and the website performance has to suffer because of that, well that's on you because you should
                    have thought about that, there is an overlap between two different specialisations web development
                    and web design you going to be mindful about these things and always have the bigger picture in you
                    mind. Technically you're the designer but you must also design the website in such a way that's not
                    going to pose problems to the developers. Finally we're talking about <b>Font attributes and
                        roles</b> let's say that you picked your font or fonts for your project. Next you need to decide
                    on the font rules and their attributes and roll meaning what font will be used for what element for
                    the headings what will you choose for paragraphs, what will it be and attribute meaning seze,
                    height, line height and so on. In regards to roles it's very simple when you're using a single font
                    family for the entire website because all the elements will be using fonts from that family. But
                    when you're using two different font families or as they're also called typefaces, then it gets a
                    bit trickier. Personally i like to use to fonts with the greatest readability for smaller elements
                    in my UI like body text, buttons, menus, captions and that sort of things and i'll use the other
                    typefaces on larger elements like headings so that takes care of roles. Now we need to talk about
                    attributes. How do you pick the right font size, font weight, letter spacing, and all that. well,
                    when it comes to font sizes because that's probably the biggest dealthankfully we have something
                    called type scales</p>
                <p>Key takeaways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To properly define the typography of your project, there are a few steps you need to follow.
                    </li>
                    <li>First: where you want to get your fonts from (I recommend Google Fonts or Adobe fonts) then
                        decide which
                        fonts would work best for the barnd and audience, base on the massage you want your website to
                        convey.
                        Fonts should also be picked using criteria like readability and loading time.</li>
                    <li>After you you picked your font(s), you need to set the proper roles and attributes (size, line,
                        height, weight, etc)</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- akhir typography -->

        <p>
            Nineth key takeaway
            Start your typography process by defining the type scale, font weights and line heights.
            Use tools like type scale and archetype to make this type easier.
            If you design app allows it, create text styles for elements like headings and paragraphs.

            Tenth key takeaway
            Spacing and sizing are very important in UI design because they will dictate the amound of whitespace and
            also the visual hierarchy.
            For spacing and sizing elements, use the 8pt system where every margin, padding, width etc. is a multiple of
            8.
            Grid are not always necesary and can sometimes add an unwanted degree of complexity to a project.

            Eleventh key takeaway
            Icons sould be meaningful and use a consistent style throughout.
            Some icons works just fine by themselves (e.g. social icons), but usually you want to pair them with text.
            Use stock photos sparingly and avoid the cheesy, over-used, clichee ones.
            Whenever possible, use photos that are provided by the client. Keep it real.

            Twelveth key takeaway
            A website header is usually the top section of a webpage taht contains the logo, navigatian menu, a
            cal-to-action and optionally a search form.
            A header is highly customizable and can hold other types of content.
