    <p>in this session, i'll write anything that i'm thinking to checkout how far my english skill goes. I dont realy care about grammar. if i find the wrong writing structure in this writing or not correct word. no matter or if i type wrong word, it's ok to be wrong for. the purpose of this writing is to accustome myself writing in english. if i'am able to write in any language it will easy to speak, listen or read. I dont have to look at the dictionary. if i want to write some word and i don't know the it's translate in english i will write in another way. in the future, if i remember, i will read again this writing and i am sure that i will smile or laugh when i read it. but it will not happen if my english skill not improved. I will save all of my grammar summary in this website. I believe that it will be more easy to learn back what we've learnt before then learn something new. It's important to me to master english language. there are many references that i can't find in another language. english is world language. if i master englis and able to speak english i will be the civil world. I'm still thinking that this writing is so bad, but the important think for now is to keep writing what i'm thingking and dont stop.</p>
